# MovieCinemaDatabase
This project is a C-based application that creates and manages a database of movies for a Movie Cinema. It provides functionality for users to add movies to the database by specifying details such as genre, name, and rating. The program also includes features to display all movies in a neatly formatted table and update the rating of an existing movie. This project demonstrates fundamental concepts of the C programming language, including the use of strings, structures, variable scopes, and basic input/output operations. By combining these elements, the project offers a practical example of how C can be used to build and manipulate a simple, yet functional, database system.
